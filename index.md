This application is a multiplatform tool to archive photos at cheapest cost possible.

It is based on a peer-to-peer archiving architecture. The main goal is to keep at lead one copy of your photos and video on a remote location at cheapest cost possible.   

You and your friends will have a one time investisment to do in a external disk to put a copy of your media as well a a copy of your friend data.

# GOMP vs Cloud architecture
Yes cloud is cheap when you have hundred of photos, but when you have tousands of photo,  the cost increase exponentionnaly.

For 50k medias, photos and videos having around 1 terabytes of data, I experience with Google, Amazon, etc... and I decide to stop using cloud when my bills reaches 40$ per months.  You use theses clouds service during 3 months and you already pay the amount needed to buy a 5TB external hard drive.  5 times the space you need to archive your medias.  You can share disk space with your friend and keep you media safe.
